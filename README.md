# SkinDiseaseClassification
This project is a machine learning-based application for classifying skin diseases using neural network models. The application is designed to classify a final seven distinct skin disease categories from various model architecutres, showcasing the practical application of machine learning techniques in healthcare. It features an interactive web interface built with Streamlit for real-time predictions and user-friendly interaction.
